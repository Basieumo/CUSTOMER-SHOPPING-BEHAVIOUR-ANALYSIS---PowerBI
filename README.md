## Insights & Recommendation

The following are the insights found upon analyzing the database

### Customer distribution by Age segments and Gender

- The majority of customers (46%) fall within the Gen-Z demography, with the highest purchasing power.
- In all three demographics, males outperformed, making up 56% of the total customer base.
- This suggests that Millennials and females are the least active demographics, exhibit lower levels of engagement indicating a need to enhance their purchasing influence.

### Recommendation

- Targeted marketing strategies can engage Millennials by offering exclusive deals and using social media
- Understanding female customers' needs is crucial, including curating products and inclusive advertising.
- Incorporating user feedback and adapting to market trends can attract and retain these demographics, balancing the customer base and driving growth


### Customer Distribution across countries and customer segments

- Amongst the five countries, Regular customer segmentation has the highest percentage at 52%, followed by New customers at 30%, and Premium customers at 28%. 

This data suggests that we should prioritize our focus on the Premium customers in the three least performing countries: Australia, Canada, and Germany.

### Recommendation 
- Focusing on Premium customers in underdeveloped markets like Australia, Canada, and Germany can drive growth and loyalty.
- Personalized marketing, exclusive offers, and data analytics are key strategies. Tailoring products to meet Premium customer needs can create a competitive edge.

### Customer distribution by income

The analysis reveals that customers with medium income accounted for 39% of the revenue, while low-income earners contributed 33% and high-income earners made up 28%.

This distribution suggests that Relish should not solely focus on high-income customers, as a significant portion of their revenue is derived from medium and low-income earners. 

### Recommendation 
- By understanding the needs and preferences of these diverse income segments, Relish can tailor their products and marketing strategies to better serve each demographic, ultimately enhancing overall customer satisfaction and loyalty. 
- Additionally, offering tiered pricing or value-added services could attract a broader audience, ensuring a more balanced revenue stream and fostering long-term growth.

The Electronics category yielded the highest revenue, accounting for 23.6%, with Grocery following closely at 21.1%, and Books, Home Décor, and Clothing each contributing 18.1%.
To boost revenue, a strategic focus on driving sales within the Books, Home Décor, and Clothing categories is recommended. 
Upon closer examination, customers within these categories reported a significant 30% negative feedback rate, highlighting areas that require enhancement. 

### Recommendation 
- Implementing detailed feedback mechanisms to understand the specific issues faced by customers is crucial. 
- Identifying these pain points will allow the company to develop targeted solutions.

-	Analysis also indicates that promotional events such as Easter in March, mid-year promotions in July, and end-of-the-year sales in December had a positive impact on boosting sales during these periods. 

### Recommendation
